This a CLI application written in Python that will perform synthetic polynomial division. The user inputs teh divisors' constant 
term (k) and then the number of terms in the polynomial being divided. The user will then input the terms of the dividend in 
from the largest degree to the smallest. The program will then output the solution (using a algorithm created by me to perform the series of addition and multiplication) and the remainder if any.
